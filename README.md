## Installation

### Windows

To install ImHex on Windows:

1. Download the latest version of ImHex from the [releases page](https://github.com/ImHex/ImHex/releases).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Once installed, you can launch ImHex from the Start menu or desktop shortcut.

Alternatively, if you prefer a portable version, you can download a ZIP archive, extract it, and run ImHex directly without installation.

### macOS

To install ImHex on macOS:

1. Download the latest `.dmg` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/ImHex/ImHex/releases).
2. Open the `.dmg` file and drag ImHex to your Applications folder.
3. Launch ImHex from the Applications folder.

Alternatively, if you're familiar with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can install ImHex with the following command:

```bash
brew install --cask imhex
```

### Linux

To install ImHex on Linux, you have a few different options depending on your distribution.

- **Debian/Ubuntu-based systems**:

```bash
sudo apt install imhex
```

- **Arch-based systems** (Arch, Manjaro, etc.):

```bash
sudo pacman -S imhex
```

- **Building from source** (for all distributions):

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ImHex/ImHex.git
```

2. Navigate to the `ImHex` directory:

```bash
cd ImHex
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
./build.sh
```

4. Once the build is complete, run:

```bash
./ImHex
```

You may need to install dependencies such as `Qt`, `CMake`, and others depending on your system.

## Usage

### User Interface

ImHex offers a straightforward user interface, designed with ease of use in mind. Upon opening a file, you'll be greeted with a window displaying your file in a hex format, along with options to switch between other views, such as text, binary, and disassembly. The UI consists of several sections:

- **File View**: This is the central part of the interface where the binary file is displayed. You can scroll through it and select specific bytes to view or modify.
- **Sidebar**: The sidebar provides additional tools, such as bookmarks, annotations, and the file structure.
- **Hex View**: The default mode shows the raw hex values of the file.
- **Disassembly View**: For executable files, you can view the disassembled code to understand the instructions of the program.
  
### Viewing Data

ImHex allows you to view files in several different formats, depending on your needs:

- **Hexadecimal View**: The default view shows the raw hex bytes of the file. Each byte is represented by two hexadecimal characters.
- **Text View**: This view interprets the raw bytes as ASCII characters and displays them in a readable format, if applicable.
- **Binary View**: The binary representation of each byte is shown in this view.
- **Disassembly View**: When dealing with executable files, the disassembly view shows the program’s machine instructions.

You can switch between these views by using the tabs at the top of the file view area.

### Data Manipulation

ImHex provides powerful tools for manipulating the data within a file:

- **Modify Data**: You can directly modify the binary data by editing the hex values or bytes in any of the views.
- **Fill**: Use the Fill tool to fill selected regions with specific values.
- **Search**: Search for byte patterns, ASCII strings, or hex sequences within the file.
- **Template-based Parsing**: Use predefined or custom templates to interpret complex data structures, such as image headers, file formats, or network packets.

### Working with Templates

Templates are one of ImHex’s most powerful features. They allow you to create custom data parsers to visualize complex binary structures in a meaningful way. Templates can be used to decode various file formats, such as PNG, JPEG, or executable file headers.

To use templates, simply load the file and then apply the relevant template from the template manager. You can also create your own templates for specific use cases. Templates make it easy to analyze large binary files by breaking them down into easily understandable structures.
